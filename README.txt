Steps to perform to make sure code is running.
1. Upload the Descriptive.ipynb file in colab.
2. Execute the steps from the first.
3. All pre defined library must executed.

* Pre-processing and Model Implementation		 *
**************************************************

To make sure the code can be successfully run in Jupyter Notebook, you have to make sure that:
1. Stanford Dog Dataset "Images" must be in the working dictionary.
2. In second cell, "data = (sys='/')" for Mac system and "data = (sys='\\')" for windows system.
3. Because of the large size of the dataset. About 50Gib memory are needed for this dataset. If there is not enough space,you can use virtual memory to process. Additionally, it can not be run in Google Colab because of memory limitation.
4. In local environment, it will cost about 50 hours to train the model using CPU.
